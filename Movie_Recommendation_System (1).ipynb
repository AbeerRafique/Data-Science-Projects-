**Movie Weighted Rating and Popularity Ranking Pipeline**\n","\n"," **Purpose**\n","\n","This section explains, in simple non-technical terms, how the code identifies the best and most fairly rated movies.  \n","The goal is to balance both *how good a movie’s rating is* and *how many people rated it*.  \n","This helps ensure that the top-rated movies are not just highly rated by a few people, but are also widely trusted by a large audience.\n","\n","\n","\n","- **Step 1: Set a Fair Rule — Only Popular Movies Count**\n","\n","    The code first sets a **vote threshold**.  \n","    This means that only movies that received a certain minimum number of votes are considered for ranking.  \n","\n","    This is done because a movie rated 10/10 by ten people is not as reliable as one rated 9/10 by thousands of viewers.  \n","    The code chooses the 92nd percentile, meaning only the top 8% of movies with the highest vote counts will be included.\n","\n","\n","- **Step 2: Keep Only Those Popular Movies**\n","\n","    After defining the threshold, the dataset is filtered to include only the movies that meet or exceed this vote count.  \n","    This ensures that the movies considered are both well-known and widely reviewed.\n","\n","\n","- **Step 3: Prepare the Key Variables**\n","\n","  For each movie, the code extracts several important numbers:\n","  - **V:** The total number of votes the movie received  \n","  - **R:** The average rating given to the movie  \n","  - **C:** The average rating across all movies in the dataset  \n","  - **M:** The minimum number of votes required to be considered (the threshold)\n","\n","  These values are then used in a weighted rating formula to balance popularity and quality.\n","\n","\n","- **Step 4: Calculate a Fair Weighted Rating**\n","\n","  Instead of using the movie’s raw average rating alone, the code calculates a **weighted average** using the formula:\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"n84ieaQ8TSid"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["    weighted_avg = (V / (V + M) * R) + (M / (V + M) * C)\n","\n","This formula adjusts the rating based on how many people voted:\n","- Movies with many votes rely more on their own rating (R).  \n","- Movies with fewer votes rely more on the overall average rating (C).  \n","\n","This prevents little-known movies with very few votes from appearing unfairly high in the rankings.\n","\n","**Step 5: Rank the Movies**\n","\n","Once the weighted averages are calculated, the movies are sorted from highest to lowest.\n","\n","**The top 20 movies are then displayed along with their**:\n","\n","  - Title  \n","  - Original average rating  \n","   - Total vote count  \n","  - Weighted average  \n","  - Popularity score  \n","\n","This provides a reliable list of top-performing movies.\n","\n","\n","**Step 6: Visualize the Results**\n","\n","  Finally, the code creates a **bar chart** that displays the top 20 movies and their weighted ratings.\n","\n","   This visual representation makes it easier to identify which movies consistently perform well according to both popularity and ratings.\n","\n","**Summary**\n","\n","This pipeline:\n","1. Filters out movies with too few votes.  \n","2. Calculates a weighted average rating that balances quality and popularity.  \n","3. Sorts and displays the top 20 movies based on this fair score.  \n","4. Visualizes the results in a clear bar chart.\n","\n","In simple terms, the code finds the **most reliably top-rated movies** — not just those with high ratings, but those with strong audience support as well.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"HUsYHsmwU03X"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"rHXQIWAdWhUT"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"AZ_gmNEtWhmq"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#

example, in a weighted formula or machine learning model), the column with bigger numbers (`vote_count`) will dominate and affect the result more than others.\n","Normalization balances that so each

Why This Matters**\n","\n","You want the computer to **understand what each movie is about** so it can find and recommend similar ones.\n","However, computers can’t understand words — they understand **numbers**.\n","So, we use a method called **TF-IDF** to turn the text into numbers that show how important each word is.\n","\n","\n","\n","**3. How TF-IDF Works (In Simple Words)**\n","\n","* Common words like *“the”*, *“a”*, or *“on”* are **not very helpful**, so the computer gives them **low importance**.\n","* Unique and meaningful words like *“Pandora”*, *“alien”*, or *“Marine”* are **very informative**, so they get **high importance**.\n","* This process is done for **every movie’s summary** to create a numerical “map” of what each movie is about.\n","\n","\n","**4. What Happens Next**\n","\n","After this transformation:\n","\n","* Every movie becomes a **vector (a list of numbers)** that represents its story.\n","* The computer can now **compare these numbers** to find which movies have **similar plots or themes**.\n","\n","For example, if you liked *Avatar*, the system might recommend other movies about **space, aliens, or interplanetary adventures**, because their overviews share similar word patterns.\n","\n","\n","\n","### **5. In Simple Terms**\n","\n","You’ve taught the computer to:\n","\n","* **Read movie summaries**,\n","* **Understand their meaning in numerical form**, and\n","* **Find movies that are similar based on storylines** — even without using ratings or popularity yet.\n","\n","Would you like me to add the **next markdown section** showing how to find *similar movies using this TF-IDF data*
